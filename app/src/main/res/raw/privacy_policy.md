# IQ Master — Privacy Policy

**Last updated: January 2026**

This Privacy Policy explains how IQ Master ("we", "us", "our") collects, uses, and shares information when you use the IQ Master mobile application (the "App").

## 1. Information We Collect

### a) Information you provide directly
The App does not require registration. Your high scores are stored locally and optionally synced to our cloud service. If you contact support, you may provide an email address or other contact information voluntarily.

### b) Information collected automatically
- **Advertising identifiers:** Ad networks (e.g., Google) use device advertising identifiers (Android Advertising ID) for ad delivery and measurement.
- **Usage data:** Anonymous usage statistics or crash reports if you install analytics/crash SDKs.
- **Local data:** High scores are stored locally on your device and optionally synced to Firebase Firestore.
- **Authentication:** We use Firebase Anonymous Authentication to identify your device for cloud sync.

### c) Third-party collection
Ad networks, measurement providers, and other third-party SDKs integrated into the App may collect information about your device and usage. See their privacy policies for details.

## 2. Ads & Consent

We use Google AdMob to serve in-app ads. We use Google's User Messaging Platform (UMP) to present a consent form where required (e.g., EU/EEA). The consent form allows users to choose personalized ads or non-personalized ads.

- **Personalized ads:** Ads tailored to your interests based on signals and data.
- **Non-personalized ads:** Ads not based on your interests. We add the `npa=1` flag to AdMob requests when you choose this option.
- **No Ads (opt-out):** The App provides an in-app opt-out that disables loading banner and interstitial ads on that device for this App.

Note: Even when you choose non-personalized ads or opt-out in-app, third-party ad networks may still collect certain device information as described in their own policies.

## 3. How We Use Information

- To display and measure ads (per your consent).
- To store local high scores and sync them to the cloud.
- To show leaderboards combining your local and cloud scores.
- To respond to support requests if you contact us.

## 4. Sharing & Third Parties

We do not sell personal data. We share data with ad networks and their partners to serve and measure ads (e.g., Google AdMob). Those third parties are responsible for their own data handling; review their privacy policies for details.

## 5. Data Retention

Local high scores remain on your device until you clear them or uninstall the App. Cloud scores remain in Firebase Firestore until you clear them via the app. Third-party data retention is governed by each third party's policies.

## 6. Your Choices

- **Ad consent:** Change your ad personalization choice by using the "Reset Ads Choice" option in the App (High Scores screen). UMP may re-display the consent form.
- **No Ads:** Choose the in-app No Ads option to disable ads for the App on your device.
- **Device advertising settings:** Reset or limit your advertising ID via your device settings.
- **Clear local data:** Use the in-app "Clear Scores" button to delete saved high scores.

## 7. Children

The App is not directed to children under 13. If your distribution targets children, you must follow COPPA and may need to disable personalized ads.

## 8. Security

We implement reasonable safeguards to protect data. No transmission or storage method is completely secure; treat sensitive information accordingly.

## 9. Third-Party Links & SDKs

The App integrates third-party SDKs including Google Mobile Ads, UMP, and Firebase. These SDKs may collect data in accordance with their policies:

- [Google Privacy & Terms](https://policies.google.com/privacy)
- [Google Ads technologies](https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads)
- [Firebase Privacy](https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy)

## 10. Contact

If you have questions or want data removed, contact:

## 11. Changes to this Policy

We may update this policy. We will post changes on this page with an updated revision date.
