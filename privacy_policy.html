  <section>
    <p>This Privacy Policy explains how IQ Master ("we", "us", "our") collects, uses, and shares information when you use the IQ Master mobile application (the "App"). This page is tailored to the App's functionality: local high scores, Google AdMob ads, and the Google UMP consent flow. This is a template — please review and finalize with your legal counsel before publishing.</p>
  </section>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
  <section>
    <h3>a) Information you provide directly</h3>
    <p>The App does not require registration. If you contact support, you may provide an email address or other contact information voluntarily.</p>

    <h3>b) Information collected automatically</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Advertising identifiers:</strong> Ad networks (e.g., Google) use device advertising identifiers (Android Advertising ID) for ad delivery and measurement.</li>
      <li><strong>Usage data:</strong> Anonymous usage statistics or crash reports if you install analytics/crash SDKs (not included by default in this sample).</li>
      <li><strong>Local data:</strong> High scores are stored locally on your device (SharedPreferences) and are not sent to our servers by default.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>c) Third-party collection</h3>
    <p>Ad networks, measurement providers, and other third-party SDKs integrated into the App may collect information about your device and usage. See their privacy policies (links below) for details.</p>
  </section>

  <h2>2. Ads & Consent</h2>
  <section>
    <p>We use Google AdMob to serve in-app ads. We use Google’s User Messaging Platform (UMP) to present a consent form where required (e.g., EU/EEA). The consent form allows users to choose personalized ads or non-personalized ads.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Personalized ads:</strong> Ads tailored to your interests based on signals and data.</li>
      <li><strong>Non-personalized ads:</strong> Ads not based on your interests. We add the <code>npa=1</code> flag to AdMob requests when you choose this option.</li>
      <li><strong>No Ads (opt-out):</strong> The App provides an in-app opt-out that disables loading banner and interstitial ads on that device for this App.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Note: Even when you choose non-personalized ads or opt-out in-app, third-party ad networks may still collect certain device information as described in their own policies.</p>
  </section>

  <h2>3. How We Use Information</h2>
  <section>
    <ul>
      <li>To display and measure ads (per your consent).</li>
      <li>To store local high scores and show leaderboards on your device.</li>
      <li>To respond to support requests if you contact us.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <h2>4. Sharing & Third Parties</h2>
  <section>
    <p>We do not sell personal data. We share data with ad networks and their partners to serve and measure ads (e.g., Google AdMob). Those third parties are responsible for their own data handling; review their privacy policies for details.</p>
  </section>

  <h2>5. Data Retention</h2>
  <section>
    <p>Local high scores remain on your device until you clear them or uninstall the App. Third-party data retention is governed by each third party's policies.</p>
  </section>

  <h2>6. Your Choices</h2>
  <section>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Ad consent:</strong> Change your ad personalization choice by using the "Reset Ads Choice" option in the App (High Scores screen). UMP may re-display the consent form.</li>
      <li><strong>No Ads:</strong> Choose the in-app No Ads option to disable ads for the App on your device.</li>
      <li><strong>Device advertising settings:</strong> Reset or limit your advertising ID via your device settings.</li>
      <li><strong>Clear local data:</strong> Use the in-app "Clear Scores" button to delete saved high scores.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <h2>7. Children</h2>
  <section>
    <p>The App is not directed to children under 13. If your distribution targets children, you must follow COPPA and may need to disable personalized ads.</p>
  </section>

  <h2>8. Security</h2>
  <section>
    <p>We implement reasonable safeguards to protect data. No transmission or storage method is completely secure; treat sensitive information accordingly.</p>
  </section>

  <h2>9. Third-Party Links & SDKs</h2>
  <section>
    <p>The App integrates third-party SDKs including Google Mobile Ads and UMP. These SDKs may collect data in accordance with their policies:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Privacy & Terms</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Ads technologies</a></li>
    </ul>
